libcore
=======

libcore is a library of common data structures, algorithms,
and tools for C language programming. The initial target
platform is FreeBSD running some version of GCC, but libcore
strives to use only ANSI C in order to maximize portability
to other platforms and compilers.

libcore is released under the Modified BSD license.
