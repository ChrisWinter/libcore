DArray
    * darray_prepend: reserve extra capacity at the front of
      the internal array to amortize the cost of prepending
      elements.
    * darray_slice: figure out the semantics of slices, and
      then add this functionality back.

Error Handling
    * Asserts: add build-time switch to turn asserts off. This
      would have to then enable alternate logic that would
      gracefully fail instead of blowing up the program.

Memory Management
    * Add a slab allocator to enhance memory performance of
      data structures

Build System
    * Enhance to build shared and static libraries
    * Build-time configurations
